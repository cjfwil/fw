- blinn-phong implementation
- lighting, normal and specular maps
- figure a way to use world matrix instead of adding a view pos vector

- c++ program which compile all the shaders in the folder automatically

x Mipmapping for textures
- skybox

- large terrain
- octree partitioned objects in world

- proper shader loading architecture

x imgui

- ini file preserves window dimensions and position across sessions

- sharpening image processing filter % controllable

- infinite view matrix

x dont reload duplicate textures <<- implement hash table for this

- load and represent materials 

- why is there a null texture in sponza?
- also there is no top geometery to the south door frame? Is that an issue with model or my code?

- no backface culling for vines and chains?

- real time dir light updating
- add point light

- every texture has its own blend state not all materials are set to having alpha blend
